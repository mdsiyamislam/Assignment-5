1. Difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll

getElementById("idName") → Selects only one element by its unique ID. Always returns a single element.

getElementsByClassName("className") → Selects multiple elements having the same class. Returns a HTMLCollection (array-like).

querySelector("selector") → Selects the first element that matches the CSS selector.

querySelectorAll("selector") → Selects all elements that match the CSS selector. Returns a NodeList (which can be looped with forEach).



2. How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?

let newDiv = document.createElement("div");



3. What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?
If you click a button inside a <div>, first button’s click handler runs, then <div>’s click handler runs.



4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

Event Delegation = attaching an event listener to a parent element, instead of every child element.

Then using event.target we check which child was clicked.

Useful because: 

Saves memory (don’t need to attach 1000 listeners).

Works with dynamically added elements.




5. Difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation()

preventDefault() → Stops the default browser action.
